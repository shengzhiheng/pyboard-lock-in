# PyBoard Lock-In Amplifier

The **PyBoard Lock-In Amplifier** (LIA) is a very low-cost, easy was to implement digital lock-in amplifier using a microcontroller called PyBoard. This originated from a summer physics project at Grinnell College to survey lakes for the 3D distribution of algae underwater. The source code for the PyBoard LIA can be accessed from the header link or at [https://github.com/shengzhiheng/pyboard-lock-in](https://github.com/shengzhiheng/pyboard-lock-in).

If you are not familiar, a [lock-in amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock-in_amplifier) is good at extracting a small signal from a relatively high background noise. The signal can be resolved from a noise a few thousand to even a million times stronger in some cases. This makes the LIA very powerful in detecting signals from a naturally noisy environment.
